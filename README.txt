This module is an optional part of the Ubercart module and exists to integrate
Ubercart functions with CiviCRM.



To install this module:
- Copy the uc_civicrm directory
- Then visit the admin/build/modules page and enable
Ubercart/CiviCRM Integration module in the Ubercart - extra section.
- Add location types 'Ubercart_Billing' and 'Ubercart_Shipping' in civicrm to store shipping and billing address

@todo - use _uc_civicrm_get_locations() to specify location type rather than hard-coded names
& build a form to set the types

When a customer buys something from the Ubercart store, the name and address
information they provide is added to CiviCRM. If the customer has a simple
contact record generated by syncing CiviCRM from the Drupal user table, that
record is updated with the new information. If no contact record exists, one is
created.

Then the new or updated contact is added to the 'Purchasers' group or group
selected in the admin screen. A contribution record is added to the contact's
history and the 'Purchases' tab on the contact's dashboard entry is populated
with a link to the contact's order history in Ubercart.
